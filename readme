This framework provides maximal freedom in implementing MVC-patterned client-side
apps.
A view is a view and a controller a controller, whatever you like to look like, as
class as function as plain object - I don't care.
This stuff should be placed underneith pages/
Implementation can be done in ES6 and is transpiled to ES5. But you are not forced to
do so.
The project contains a navigator (alfnavigator) which helps you creating navigatable views.
For this just create a MVC like analogous to pages/welcome and register the navigation-target
as in AppController.js done.
In case you want to read the source-code as served to the browser, the gulp-task's destination
is in build/
When starting the server via gulp, gulp is running the app.js in a spawned-child process.
In this app.js you can either build you backend directly when it is running in node or otherwise
you can configer the proxy in there for your needs to delegate certain url patterns through the
proxy to your backend server.

Testing:
The folder to store all tests is public/test
Test can be run by navigating the browser to pages/test.html

Install:
>npm install
>bower install

 To run the server and gulp watcher:
 >gulp
